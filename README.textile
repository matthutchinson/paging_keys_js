h1. Paging Keys

h2. About

Keyboard short cuts for paging through listings one item at at time (and across entire pages).  Inspired by the navigation at "FFFFOUND!":http://ffffound.com/

The example operates on "micro-formatted":http://microformats.org/ html ( "hAtom":http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom ).  The script uses either the "prototype":http://www.prototypejs.org/ or "jquery":http://jquery.com/ js libraries and "hotkey.js":http://la.ma.la/blog/diary_200511041713.htm for key event hooks. Take a look at "this video explanation":http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1409-heres-a-demo-of-some-thoughtful-ui-on-ffffoundcom from "Ryan Singer":http://twitter.com/rjs of "37 Signals":http://www.37signals.com

h2. "Demo":http://matthutchinson.github.com/sandbox/paging_keys/examples/prototype/example.html

Holy explanations Batman!, there is a "working (prototype) demo here":http://matthutchinson.github.com/sandbox/paging_keys/examples/prototype/example.html or you can try the "demo with jQuery":http://matthutchinson.github.com/sandbox/paging_keys/examples/jquery/example.html

h2. Latest Changes

* Fixed floating navigation positioning in "jquery":http://jquery.com/ version (wrong selector doh!)
* Added "jquery":http://jquery.com/ support thanks to Peter O'Toole ("peteot":http://github.com/peteot)
* Fixed floating navigation links, (next/prev were linked the wrong way round)
* Abstracted out library specific javascript functions (e.g. selector etc.)
* Added some jquery unit testing, and jquery examples

h2. Caveats

Ongoing issues with this script include;

* needs more testing on different browsers
* needs more testing coverage in general
* there are some places where CSS id selectors would suit better over class selectors
* so far manually tested on the following mac browsers; 
** Safari 3/4, FireFox 3/3.5, Opera 9+, Camino 1.6.9

h2. Setup / Using

h3. Requirements

What do you need?

* "prototype":http://www.prototypejs.org/ (>= 1.6.0.3) OR "jquery":http://jquery.com/ (>= 1.3.2)
* a working keyboard and browser
* for the example - a sense of "1970's Batman humor":http://adamwest.tripod.com/b-lectur.htm

h3. Using

To use on your own website, simply;

* markup your entry titles with the following CSS hierarchy; .hentry h2 a.entry-title (the example uses the "hAtom":http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom style)
* include the prototype OR jquery library (e.g. from "ajax.googleapis.com":http://code.google.com/apis/ajax/)
* include the appropriate paging_keys.js javascript somewhere on your page
* add pagination html to each page as shown in the example (in "Rails":http://rubyonrails.org/, if you're using "will_paginate":http://wiki.github.com/mislav/will_paginate, you'll get this for free)
* optionally add the paging-nav element somewhere on each page, and include the CSS for it
* thats it! 

Make your browser height small enough to engage vertical scrolling, then use j/k to move up/down through listing (and across the pagination).  You can also use h/l to move between entire pages. So;

* j next item (down)
* k prev item (up)
* h next page 
* l next page

h3. Configuration

The config variable in pagingKeys can be used to customize the class to suit your own HTML/CSS selectors.  See the comments alongside each attribute for more info. 

h3. Minimized

The "YUI compressor":http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/ has been used successfully to minimise paging_keys.js (a minimised version is NOT included in the release).  All unit tests included run on a non-compressed script.


h2. Example Configuration Explanation 

Four "micro-formatted":http://microformats.org/ ( "hAtom":http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom ) example pages with pagination links (in the "will_paginate":http://wiki.github.com/mislav/will_paginate style) The example uses the #bottom anchor link on the last post of each page, so paging backwards will start at the bottom and work its way up through the page.  Each example page has an optional paging navigation key at the top right corner (when javascript is available).  In the example the "prototype":http://www.prototypejs.org/ OR "jquery":http://jquery.com/ library is loaded from "ajax.googleapis.com":http://code.google.com/apis/ajax/ (this is a good idea).

Have a look at the example html documents and the tests for more information.
               
h2. Why use the 'HJKL' keys?
    
Everyone has their own preferences/ideas on which keys work best. I chose what seems to be the accepted default right now and the comments below enforce this point somewhat.

"...because j and k are on the home row. Most keyboards have a little nubbin on the j so you can find it by touch. There is also some precedent for the pair. j/k move the cursor down/up in vi for example..."

"...Google reader / Google Mail use the same keys..."

"...Earlier computers had no need for arrow keys, so all the basic vi commands use keys you’d find on a very limited keyboard..."

"...But they’re also very nice since it’s where the right hand sits when you’re a touch typist. j and k take almost no effort to type..."

"...page up/down and cursor keys are not always available on every keyboard, or can be hard to find on laptops or shortened keyboards..."
